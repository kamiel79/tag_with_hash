Automatically turn terms into tags if you precede them with a #. Nonexisting tags are created.

== Description ==

Adding tags on the fly by just prepending a word you want to use as a tag with a "#" was a functionality I missed in the Wordpress backend.

== Installation ==
1. Unzip the plugin in your plugin directory. 
2. Activate the plugin in Wordpress.
3. Edit a post and turn a term (a-zA-Z_) into a tag.
